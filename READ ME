(WHAT THE APP WOULD BE IF I UNDERSTOOD SWIFT BETTER)

DESCRIPTION
————————————
This IOS application will allow people to join and create a group for a large community. The potential applications for groups could be a neighborhood watch group where local crime is posted to keep neighbors and friends up to date on what is happening in the community to events like festivals happening. Users will be able to create groups, join groups, make posts in the groups, and be able to comment in the group. 

APP EVALUATION
———————————

Habit: The users in the group can post to the group chat or timeline at any time.

Market: Any person who would like to inform a community of any event happening. The main people targeted are those that live or are in an area where crime and danger happens often, so people can stay in the know of what crime or danger is happening as fast as possible.
